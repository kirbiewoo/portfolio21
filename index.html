					<p class="overview-p">
						In a senior user interface design course, we were
						tasked to conduct research for a selected design
						domain to understand users’ needs and goals for
						potential application opportunities. Seeing that
						Canada is home to some truly stunning scenery, more
						people are gaining interest in camping within the
						past decade. However, there are currently no
						application that can provide detailed information
						about camping all in one app., campers are usually
						required to open up several tabs and apps to look
						for the information they need. We saw an opportunity
						to create an application that serves as an
						all-inclusive platform for both beginners and
						experienced campers.

					<h1 class="gocamp-h3">Frustrations</h1>
					<p>
						Some of the biggest concern for campers are
						preparation before camping, and running into
						technical problem during camping such as “how to set
						up tents properly”, “what to do when I encounter a
						bear” and such. Although there are many existing
						applications for camping, most of these focus on
						certain campgrounds in one region. Campers are left
						to find solutions on several browsers and apps when
						they encounter issues in their camping trips. (see
						below for users' comments on existing applications)

					<p>
						We began researching for insight on this issue by
						researching the challenges these existing
						applications pose. We then took these insights and
						created our own application interface that could
						better guide campers on their trips.

						Insight: Information does not have a clear hierarchy
					</h1>
					<br />
					<p>
						With the current travel applications designed
						camping, we noticed they lack hierarchy in
						information, and the applications do not interact
						with users enough to keep them motivated and
						continue using the app. While most campers camp in
						groups, most of the application consists of banal
						and tedious interface that does not allow
						collaboration on apps for trip planning. Plus, a lot
						of apps are not accessible while the internet is
						poor.

					<h1 class="gocamp-h3">Proposal</h1>
					<p>
						Camping has been growing in popularity, however none
						of the current applications provide trip planning
						and skill learning all in one application, hence we
						came up with the idea where users can search up
						campsites and learn about camping at the same
						time.In addition, according to (Gursoy, Chen & Y.Lu,
						2012), only 2% of the population in the United
						States camp alone, for that reason, users could use
						our application to create and customize checklists
						and share information among contacts who are also
						taking part in the camping trip rather than relying
						on endless struggle of group texts.
						<br><br>
						With goCamp, both beginners and experienced campers
						can learn about all the information they need to
						prepare for their trips. Campers can also view the
						saved articles offline and use the AR camera to
						detect plants in the wild. The articles provided by
						our app will assist in addressing the frequently
						asked issues and information.

					<h1 class="gocamp-h3 ">Reflection/ Takeaway</h1>
					<p>
						Planning a camping trip should be a fun, exciting experience that flows smoothly into the
						camping journey itself. The proposal of goCamp aims to offer that with a friction-free user
						flow. I was satisfied as to how far we went with our project. As the was one of the first user
						experience courses I have taken, it was an intense experience to be thrown in the deep end of
						integrating design thinking with real business problems that were also drawn from my own
						experiences. This project also made me realize the importance of communicating an idea and
						executing it at a high level. <br><br>

						However, in hindsight, one part I would have wanted to improve is to consider the overall mobile
						experience. For example, the body text on the content pages (Places and Camping 101) is too
						small and may not be legible on mobiles. I learned that it is important to create a
						mobile-friendly application that allows the user to accomplish their goals efficiently.
