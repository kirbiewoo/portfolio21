                        During my time working as a UX/UI designer for BCSEA, I was collaborating with other designers
                        to redesign the BCSEA website. The bcsea.org website was created over 10 years ago and has not
                        been redesigned since. Our goal is to redesign the most revenue-generating pages and
                        focus on pages that have been flagged most problematic: the <b>membership pages</b> and
                        <b>members'
                            accounts</b>. The poor design fo the members’ account is one of the reasons individuals are
                        not signing up or renewing their memberships. The following case study elucidates the findings
                        and research of the business
                        problem
                        and how the research helped us build an intervention that would alleviate customer frustration
                        and provide value to the business.

                    <p>
                        While having a high retention rate for their current websites, the board notices the membership
                        signup rate is dropping, and members have stopped renewing their memberships. Since the
                        organization depends on memberships and members donate to maintain operation, the problem is
                        acute and is in dire need of a solution. <br> <br>

                        Additionally, the site itself contains information that is of interest to both members and
                        non-members alike.  However, Google analytics have demonstrated that while initial interest is
                        good, the number of users who continue interacting with the site <b>beyond one minute is
                            limited</b>.
                        This is the likely result of a decade of uploading information without regard to how that
                        information is organized. <br><br>

                    <p>To understand the underlying issue of membership sign-up, I have devised a user flow for the
                        current membership sign-up workflow. Through drawing up the user flow, I noticed the sign-up
                        process contains a lot of redundant and unnecessary questions, for instance, the process asks
                        individuals to login when they are signing up. In most cases, people who want to sign up for an
                        individual member does not already have a BCSEA account. </p>

                    <p>Within the team, we have each evaluated the BCSEA site interface using Heuristic Evaluation
                        separately to finish tasks like membership sign-up and search up webinars. We have also invited
                        10 participants (young professionals in the clean and renewable energy sector and students). The
                        interview was done remotely using Google Meet and we observed the participants while they speak
                        out their thoughts and process of the navigation. Our findings have concluded several issues
                        below are deemed most problematic:

                    </p> <br><br>

                    <h1 class="general-h2"> <b>01.</b> Participants did not have the option to signup from
                        the login page.</h1>
                    <p>Participants must sign up from the “become a member” button that is hidden under the “join” tab
                        in the navigation bar, which relies on recognition rather than recall.
                    </p>

                    <br><br>

                    <h1 class="general-h2"> <b>02.</b> “Signup” and “BCSEA Webinars” are both hidden as
                        sub-menu
                        items</h1>
                    <p>Participants have to look through all the menu tabs to locate the buttons. Additionally, there
                        are two “BCSEA Webinar” buttons after log-in, with one of the buttons being broken and asking
                        participants to sign in again. This resulted in 4 participants signing in again only to end up
                        on the same page, and repeated the process until facilitators had given them hints to try the
                        second webinar button.

                    <h1 class="general-h2"> <b>03.</b> Information are unorganized and misleading</h1>
                    <p>A lot of the pages are unorganized and contains disconnected information that misleads users
                        elsewhere. For example, users received a popup message that says “Join the BCSEA Community” on
                        the sign-up page, however the message is actually intended for newsletter sign-up. The word
                        choice is deceptive, causing many users to misunderstand that as membership sign-up.

                        from navigating through the BCSEA sites and sign-up for a membership. The primary goal is to
                        <b>improve the process for membership signup and increase the number of membership sign-up
                            renewals</b>. The secondary focus would be on <b>increasing traffic to the site and donation

                            generate revenue for the organization</b>. In general, the overall accessibility and
                        aesthetic of
                        the website also have to be taken into account.</p> <br>

                        practices in BC and Canada. As such their website should project that image as well. Though
                        their site contains a lot of interesting information, they are not particularly exciting, nor is
                        the information architecture well arranged. We thought of several “How Might We” questions to
                        help us brainstorm.

                        solution,

                        the login button is combined with sign-up and relocated to the top right corner as a
                        standalone
                        button to make it more apparent on the interface. To increase clear
                        visibility of system status, the BCSEA blue color could be used to highlight the button.

                        As some participants had confused the donation button as the login/sign-up button, we combined
                        login with sign-up and relocating it to the top right corner as a standalone button to make it
                        more apparent on the interface. To increase clear visibility of system status, the BCSEA blue
                        color could be used to highlight the button. The “request new password” button has been replaced
                        with “sign-up”, and moving “request new password” below the password text box where users will
                        easily see it. This will provide “recognition rather than recall”.

                        Once users have created an account and are signed in, they are able to access the BCSEA
                        Webinars. As mentioned in the results, there are currently two “BCSEA Webinars” sub-menu. We
                        recommend removing one of the duplicated sub-menus to prevent errors in the future and for
                        better efficiency of use. With “BCSEA Webinars” being one of the primary features for
                        members of
                        the website, we suggest that it should be more easily accessible by having it as its own
                        heading
                        in
                        the navigation menu. <br><br>

                        Lastly, we recommend implementing filters on the “BCSEA Webinars” page,
                        such as search by recency, by year, and by keyword search. With the addition of filters, users
                        would be able to find specific articles related to the topic they are searching for without
                        having to scroll through the whole length of the webinars page. This will eliminate frustration,
                        and provide efficiency and ease of use for users when searching for articles.

                        This project was a good opportunity for me to practice my user research testing and interview
                        skills. I recognize that my previous projects lacked direct user input, thus making it difficult
                        to support certain design decisions. This project taught me how to work with real qualitative
                        data based on people I am building the product for, making the design more applicable for the
                        target users. As a result, the impact outcome is much more rewarding and valuing for the
                        organization.
