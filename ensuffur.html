                            Our team wants to explore the issue of animal cruelty and exploitation through critical
                            design. Animal cruelty is often masked by the framing of institutions and companies. With
                            animals, for the most part, being unable to defend themselves from human activities, they
                            are constantly being exploited.
                            Our position is that in modern society, we have the resources and affordance to conduct more
                            research about animal exploitation. We want to evoke critical thinking in the issue of
                            animal cruelty in things that may be framed as beneficial for animals.

                        <p>Ensuffur is a company that emerged from finding a niche in the market of wearing live
                            animals to counter animal cruelty of wearing fur. By wearing live animals and turning them
                            into a fashion statement, the consumers are raising awareness that these animals still need
                            help and protect them from being poached.

                        <h1 class="general-header">Context </h1>
                        <p>In the year 2020, using the animal’s skin and fur for clothing is receiving heavy backlash.
                            Ensuffur is a company that emerged from finding a niche in the market of wearing live
                            animals to counter animal cruelty of wearing fur. By wearing live animals and turning them
                            into a fashion statement, the consumers are raising awareness that these animals still need
                            help and protect them from being poached. Further, the company has partnered up with a
                            health clinic to perform monthly check-ups on these animals. <br><br>

                            To further illustrate the animal cruelty of wearing fur, I have sketched several concept
                            arts for one to envision what Ensuffur products would look like. <br><br> </p>

                        <p>Our target audience is people who only look at surface levels of animal exploitation. Meaning
                            that they (convince themselves to) believe that the companies are doing a 100% honourable
                            act and are acting in the animals’ best interest. Our target audience belongs to the upper
                            bracket. They are financially capable of protecting live exotic animals by purchasing
                            Ensuffur products. At the same time, they do not have to associate themselves with the
                            inhumane way of fur production and are still able to experience the novelty of owning
                            something rare.

                            To further strengthen the affluential influence of Ensuffur, I have chosen navy
                            blue and
                            dusty pink as the main color theme for the branding. The website uses navy as the primary
                            color and dusty pink as the secondary color for texts
                            and graphics. This color palette is intended to create a feel of modernity yet luxurious to
                            the overall user experience on site. <br><br><b>Poppins</b> is used for headers and
                            <b>Avenir (Light)</b> as body texts. The buttons are duo tone with blue and pink overlapped.
                            The color contrast is bright yet inviting.

                        <p>One of the biggest challenges we have faced as a team was our original exhibition plan got
                            disrupted
                            by Covid-19. Our orginal plan was to bring in a dog dressed in a mane as a tiger and pair it
                            with a
                            series of furnitures and fashion products to promote Ensuffur service to our audience.
                            However,
                            we
                            had to discard this plan when classes become online due to Covid-19. <br><br>The following
                            challenge
                            we
                            face
                            is to build a believable world around Ensuffur service. In order to tackle this challenge,
                            we
                            had
                            built various of artifacts to demonstrate and deliver diverse information in different
                            approaches. For example, we have created a news article to bash on

                            This project was a good opportunity for me to practice my visual and user interface skills
                            and to gain project ownership in those aspects. One part I would have wanted to improve is
                            to gain professional insights from those in the field of e-commerce to have a more effective
                            and accurate representation of a viable product. Regardless, I was able to learn and apply
                            all of the skills I have learned over the years and effectively apply them to a project that
                            I enjoyed creating with my team!
