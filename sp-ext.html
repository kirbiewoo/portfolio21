                        Spotify is a cloud-based music streaming
                        application that provides users with access to
                        millions of songs and other contents from
                        artists all over the world. With Spotify
                        premium, users can play, download music anywhere
                        and anytime they want. Spotify Premium allows
                        users to enjoy its top four features, such as
                        creating similar playlist, discover weekly
                        favourites, genre and moods, as well as daily
                        mixes.

                    <p>While we were researching our application, we noticed there was a lot of helpful information
                        online as it is a fully developed app that has been around for quite some time now. Another
                        advantage we had during research was that
                        since one of the team members was already an existing user of Spotify, she had a better
                        understanding of the core elements of the application. However, we struggled a little with
                        researching about the pain points of Spotify. Since Spotify is a fully developed application, it
                        is quite challenging to pinpoint the flaws on it as they are not obvious. Much of the pain
                        points research was based on personal experience and other surveys online.

                        simple command like “Play Spotify” will only open up the application.

                    <h1 class="general-header">Reflection</h1>
                    <p>Reflecting from our research findings, we aim to design a new feature that not only connects
                        users with music, but also connects it with the existing features seamlessly. Our users use
                        Spotify in hope of discovering new music efficiently and we kept that in mind throughout the
                        designing process. With this new feature, users no longer have to go on another app to
                        detect
                        songs and go onto Spotify to search for it again. Users are now given the right to enjoy
                        Spotify
                        and music without disrupting their experience on the app.
                        <br> <br>
                        This project provided me a sense of how to improve an application by implementing new
                        features.
                        To understand what users need or want, research and survey is necessary. If there is a
                        chance to
                        improve this project, I would create an interactive prototype to enhance the understanding
                        of
                        our feature project.
